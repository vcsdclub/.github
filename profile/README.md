## Welcome to the VCHS Software Development Club

here we teach you how to write and develop good, maintainable, code.

## Vision

I want this club

1. To **empower** students to create great things (by writing good code!)
2. To **impact** others with what we do (in a positive way) such as reaching out to the local community
3. To be **sustainable** (because I don't want this club to die right after I graduate)

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
